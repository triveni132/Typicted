# 🎮 Typicted – Web-Based Typing Game

Typicted is a fun and interactive **typing game website** designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy in an engaging way. Developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, the project combines typing practice with gamification to make learning both effective and enjoyable.  

Players are presented with a random paragraph to type within a **60-second timer**. For every correct word typed, a character (car/object) moves forward and coins are collected. Errors stop the movement with a beep sound, ensuring accuracy. At the end of the session, the game displays the player’s **Words Per Minute (WPM), correct words, coins earned, and accuracy**.
